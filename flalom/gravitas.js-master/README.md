## Live examples

These are all from the article linked above, and are in the tree in `examples/`

 * [Android Wear back gesture](https://cdn.rawgit.com/iamralpht/gravitas.js/master/examples/AndroidWear/index.html)&mdash;physics animations vs CSS transitions
 * [Springy Button](https://cdn.rawgit.com/iamralpht/gravitas.js/master/examples/Buttons/index.html)&mdash;simple spring usage
 * [Various Falling Dialogs](https://cdn.rawgit.com/iamralpht/gravitas.js/master/examples/FallingDialogs/index.html)&mdash;using the `Fall` simulation, which combines `Gravity` with a `Spring` for a soft landing
 * [Windows 8 Lock Screen](https://cdn.rawgit.com/iamralpht/gravitas.js/master/examples/LockScreen/index.html)&mdash;using `GravityWithBounce`, which is a hard landing
 * [Vertical Scrolling](https://cdn.rawgit.com/iamralpht/gravitas.js/master/examples/Scrolling/index.html)&mdash;combining `Friction` with a `Spring` to make springy scrolling, now with a more iOS-like overscroll equation
 * [iTunes Radio continuous scrolling](https://cdn.rawgit.com/iamralpht/gravitas.js/master/examples/iTunesRadio/index.html)&mdash;constant velocity combined with `Friction` to create an interactive continuous scrolling list
 * [Floating Action Button](https://cdn.rawgit.com/iamralpht/gravitas.js/master/examples/FloatingActionButton/index.html)&mdash;uses multiple `Spring`s and some state to create a Floating Action Button that works in one continuous gesture
